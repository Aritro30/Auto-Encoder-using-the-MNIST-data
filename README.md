# Auto-Encoder-using-the-MNIST-dataset

This github project is a simple implementation of the autoencoder on the MNIST dataset. Autoencoder is a neural network that learns how to compress data and then reconstruct the data back to a representation that is as close as the original input. It is an unsupervised method. The MNIST dataset contains 60000 training samples and 10000 testing samples of handwritten digits. 

For the autoencoder implementation, a neural network with 2 hidden layers (each containing 10 neurons) is created. The model is then trained for 200 epochs. Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss are used.
